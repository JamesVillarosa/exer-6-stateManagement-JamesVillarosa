Application Description: 

A flutter program about state management. This app has 3 screens which is catalog, cart, and checkout. This exercise objective is how will the data/value in each screen will pass through other screen. Here, user can add an item in catalog then it will reflect to my cart. In my cart, there is a total price base on the items in cart and user can reset the cart, checkout the items, or go back to my catalog. In the checkout screen, it will prompt user if there is no item to be check out, if there is an item, it will show all items to be checkout together by their total price. User can click the pay now button so that item will be checked out and paid.


Things I did in code:

1. Creating a flutter project
2. Typed flutter pub add provider in terminal
3. Create MyCatalog.dart and copy the code on handout
4. Create MyCart.dart and copy the code on handout
5. Create Item.dart inside the model folder and copy the code on handout
6. Revise the main.dart base on handout
7. Create shoppingcart_provider.dart inside the provider folder and copy the code on handout
8. Add checkout.dart
9. Revise the mycart.dart
10. Document

Challenges when developing the application: 

The main challenge I encoutered doing this application is how will I create the checkout screen and connect it to the other screen. Given the code in the handout it became easy for me to pass the value from one screen to another. Just a minor challenge in revising the code given on handout.
